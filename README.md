 ## why tasks-on-lan
  I used many to-do list apps. the best app I used was Google Tasksâ„¢ but it had a big problem, it is on the cloud. if I have an electricity outage or internet connection issues, I may be unable to access my tasks.
  the whole idea of tasks-on-lan is that you can access your tasks on your devices without the need to be online.

  a web app used to manage to-do lists on local area networks.
  currently, the app should be hosted on a server in a local area network and can be accessed via web browsers. more intelligent ways to run the app are to be released in the future
